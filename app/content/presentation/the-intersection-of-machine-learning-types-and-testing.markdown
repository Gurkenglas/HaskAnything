The proposed talk would have two broad themes. The first would be a quick survey of the Oml library that I helped to develop, that aims to provide mathematical, statistical and general machine learning capabilities for the OCaml programming environment. This would be a quick (and hopefully live) demo. The second part of the talk would be about my experiences. In particular, I’d like to discuss the difficulty of testing this library and what roles types can play. 

I’ve used F# and now OCaml to analyze data professionally for the past 10 years. Now at Hammer Lab, I’ve used some of the algorithms in this library to analyze a protein binding problem. I find working in the REPL an invaluable (and intuitive) experience for exploratory data analysis; types force the developer to be concise in their transformation of complex data. At the same time Oml aims to be easy in transforming that data into numerical patterns.
