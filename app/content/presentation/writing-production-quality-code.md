Production quality code not only needs to compute the correct result, but needs to do so within some given resource constraints (i.e. time and memory). 
We'll look at the most common optimizations you can use to make your Haskell code perform better and some rules of thumb you can use in your daily Haskell programming to avoid some performance problems "by design".
