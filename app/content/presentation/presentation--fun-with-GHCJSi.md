A recent new GHCJS feature is a REPL, GHCJSi. On the surface, GHCJSi looks exactly like GHCi. 
However, when a browser connects to the REPL session, all code is run inside the browser, giving the user full control over the browserâ€™s HTML document and JavaScript environment. 

I will briefly discuss the design and implementation of GHCJSi and demonstrate how to use the REPL for browser-based Haskell development, making use of various GHCJS libraries.
