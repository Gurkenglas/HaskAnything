Introduction to the concept of FRP (Functional Reactive Programming), supplemented with a guided tour through an example implementation of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life](Game of Life) using the [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reactive-banana](reactive-banana) and [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/threepenny-gui](threepenny-gui) libraries. Subsequent discussion of the [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex](reflex) library and FRP as a possible replacement for monadic `IO`. See [https://begriffs.com/posts/2016-07-27-tikhon-on-frp.html](video URL) for a detailed summary.
