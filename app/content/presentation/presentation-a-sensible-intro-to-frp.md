Introduction to the concept of FRP (Functional Reactive Programming), supplemented with a guided tour through an example implementation of [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using the [reactive-banana](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reactive-banana) and [threepenny-gui](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/threepenny-gui) libraries. Subsequent discussion of the [reflex](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex) library and FRP as a possible replacement for monadic `IO`. See [video URL](https://begriffs.com/posts/2016-07-27-tikhon-on-frp.html) for a detailed summary.
