Advanced functional programming is commonplace in academia. In this talk I will explain why it is time to bring its advantages to industry too. Through my experience with Chordify, a web start-up that brings chord recognition to the masses, I have explored the benefits of exposing open-source, cutting-edge research to a wider audience. I will share several insights gained from my experience, namely with regards to: the architecture of a functional backend, interaction between this backend and a PHP/JS frontend, handling millions of visits per month with minimal hassle, and the logistics of an internet start-up.
