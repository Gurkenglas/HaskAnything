Ryan Trinkle gives an introduction to his `reflex` library. The talk begins by introducing the interpretation of FRP realized in `reflex`, then `reflex-dom` is used to demonstrate how `reflex` can be used to create a website interacting with the Twitter API, and finally design decisions and primitives of the library are discussed.
