The introduction from the article:

> Megaparsec is a parsing library written in Haskell. It's a fork of the popular Parsec and is more up to date.
> 
> This post came into being because while there are tutorials for Parsec, there aren't many for Megaparsec. As a Haskell noob, I found myself discouraged to depend on Parsec tutorials too much, given that Megaparsec may have diverged over time.
