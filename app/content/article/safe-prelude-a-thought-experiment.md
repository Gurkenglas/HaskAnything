From the blog post:

> This is a thought experiment in a different point in the alternative prelude design space. After my blog post on readFile, I realized I was unhappy with the polymorphic nature of readFile in classy-prelude. Adding that with Haskell Pitfalls I've been itching to try something else. I have a lot of hope for the foundation project, but wanted to play with this in the short term.
