Haskell has a vibrant, talented community of very capable programmers. 
[Haskellers.com](http://www.haskellers.com/) aims to be the meeting point for these developers. 
By centralizing, we hope to make it easier for employers to find people to fill positions, and thus give Haskell a lower entrance cost into industry.
