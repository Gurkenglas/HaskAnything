From the article:

> *Caveat: This is not a monad tutorial, you should not read this to understand monads initially. If you aren’t already comfortable with monads and have used them in production code, please don’t read this. It will not impart any intution.*

> This is a short, fast and analogy-free introduction to Haskell monads derived from a categorical perspective. This assumes you are familiar with Haskell and basic category theory.
