Object-oriented development and its platforms have been well-established for years in software development. By now, a new arsenal of techniques, technologies, platforms, and languages are determining the development practices of the future. These are often superior to traditional OO techniques, languages and tools.

This series contains the presentations of 2016, focused on, or related to Haskell.

Topics

* functional programming
* reactive programming
* persistent data structures and databases
* types
* formal methods for correctness and robustness
